# Symfony JWT Authentication System #

### A basic auth system for Symfony with register and login endpoints. ###

### Some things I would add if I had more time:

* Integration test for the User entity to test the unique constraint on the email field.
* Add unit test coverage for LoginController. This is covered by the functional test, but could ideally do with a unit test too. Skipped this becuase I was low on time.
* Unit test coverage for event listener. Again, skipped this because I was low on time.
* Add a proper user provider into security.yaml.
